**Currently in progress**

**TODOS**
* Timed down movement needs to finish dropping a block and do clears & collapses
* UI stuff like score, menus, polish
* Bug: the schedule function for timer movement is mysteriously being removed sometimes. Consider scheduling another function for timer movement because of MOVEDOWN entering in

**What works?**
* Moving blocks and dropping. 
* Blocks moving down by timer.
* Rotation
* Line clearing and collapsing afterwards

**How to run**

- Install python3

- Install cocos2d for python from http://python.cocos2d.org/download.html
