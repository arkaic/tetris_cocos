# Tetris
An implementation of Tetris using Python's Cocos2D framework.

## Currently

All core mechanics working as expected. Collapsing after clearing lines is implemented using the sticky method as outlined in the link: http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/implementing-tetris-clearing-lines--gamedev-1197

There is no menu screen and no lose condition yet.

## Dependencies
- Python3
- cocos2d from http://python.cocos2d.org/download.html
